# Notes Frontend

React + Vite + Tailwind UI for the notes backend in `app`.

## Getting started

1. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Run the backend (from the project root):

```bash
node app/index.js
```

3. In a separate terminal, start the frontend dev server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and talks to the backend on `http://localhost:3000`.
